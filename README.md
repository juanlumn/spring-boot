* Why to use Spring Boot?

Previously setting up Spring projects was not easy, we needed to do:
1. Handle the Dependency management (pom.xml)
2. Define Web App Configuration (web.xml)
3. Manage Spring Beans (context.xml)
4. Implement Non Functional Requirements

This has to be done foe every new project and also has to be maintained in the time. A lot of effort.<br />
**Spring Boot simplifies this.**
